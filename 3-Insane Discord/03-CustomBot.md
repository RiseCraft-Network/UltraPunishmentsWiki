When you have followed the steps above, you can now continue setting up the Discord Integration in game.

Now get back to the server and use `/discordbot` if you closed the settings menu (or use the button in the PLUGIN NAME GUI).
When you are in the menu head over to the **General Settings**; here you have 3 buttons
* **Discord Token** The Discord token is the key which you just copied
* **Guild ID** The guild ID is the ID of your Discord server 
* **Status** The status of the bot which will be displayed as activity *(e.g. `Playing Minecraft`, `Watching 500 users`)*

Now right click your server name/server icon and press copy ID.
Now you need to press *Guild ID* at the settings GUI and paste this key.
