# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing *Ultra Punishments*!
After installing you just need to add the ``ultrapunishments.admin`` permission to yourself and execute **/upun**.

<br />

*Some extra permission nodes*
ultrapunishments.ban.execute
ultrapunishments.ban.revoke
ultrapunishments.mute.execute
ultrapunishments.mute.revoke
ultrapunishments.manage.templates
ultrapunishments.manage.settings
ultrapunishments.report.respond
ultrapunishments.warning.execute
ultrapunishments.warning.revoke
ultrapunishments.admin
ultrapunishments.manage.exclusions

If you are using BungeeCord, install Ultra Punishments there as well and setup MySQL on every Server.
The MySQL Settings can be accessed from */upun > Settings > MySQL*

<br />

After following these steps the plugin should be fully functional and ready to use!
