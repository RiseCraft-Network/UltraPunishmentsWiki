# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing *Ultra Punishments*!
After installing you just need to add the ``ultrapunishments.admin`` permission to yourself and execute **/upun**.

<br />

If you are using BungeeCord, install Ultra Punishments there as well and setup MySQL on every Server.
The MySQL Settings can be accessed from */upun > Settings > MySQL*

<br />

After following these steps the plugin should be fully functional and ready to use!
